Soil Moisture iOS Application for ESP8266 Sensor

This project contains the starter code for retrieving data from the ESP8266 sensor, and displaying it via an iOS application.
To test code, the Arduino code must be uploaded to the ESP8266 sensor and the sensor must be responsive. The Arduino code is provided in the XCode project.
